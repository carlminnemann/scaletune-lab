/* ScaleTune service worker.

   Caches the whole app, piano samples included, so that once it has been
   opened it runs with no network at all — which is the point for a practice
   tool used in rehearsal rooms and backstage.

   Note: browsers only register a service worker on a secure origin (HTTPS, or
   localhost). Served over plain http:// on a LAN address it will not install,
   and the app still works — just without the offline cache. */

   - The page itself goes to the network first, falling back to the cache when

     seen until the cache is manually cleared — which is exactly the trap that
     had an old build running during testing.
   - Everything else (the 2.5 MB of piano samples, the icons) is cache-first:
     it is large, it never changes without the cache version changing, and it
     is what makes the app work with no network.                              */
